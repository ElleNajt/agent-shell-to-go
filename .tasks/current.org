* High Priority (Bugs/Broken)

** DONE Fix markdown text box rendering bug
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Text box sometimes becomes thin and stretches down past its container.
Fixed: Added markdownContainer wrapper with flex constraints in ChatScreen.tsx (commit 29cc576)

** DONE Fix tool messages showing just tool name without args
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Sometimes we get a useless message like "Write" or "Terminal" with no args.
Fixed: Extract file_path, pattern, content from rawInput in agent-shell-to-go-mobile.el (commit fd89b7c)

** DONE Add delivery checkmarks to sent messages
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Messages sometimes get lost. Show ack checkmarks like modern chat apps (sent, delivered, read).
Fixed: Added status field and checkmark UI in ChatScreen.tsx/useMessages.ts (commit aae6afd)

** DONE WebSocket disconnect issue
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
WebSocket was disconnecting every ~5 seconds.
Root cause: Missing ping/pong keepalive mechanism.
Fix: Added proper ping/pong (54s ping, 60s pong timeout) in main.go (commit 4e21fed)

** DONE Duplicate user messages from mobile
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Messages sent from mobile appeared twice in DB.
Root cause: Backend stored message, then Emacs echoed it back via /events/message.
Fix: Added --injecting-from-mobile flag in elisp to skip echo (commit dc3060b)

* Medium Priority (Usability)

** DONE Add stop button for individual agents (interrupt without closing)
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]

** DONE Add "recent conversations" list view (sorted by last activity)
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]

** DONE Long-press on message boxes to copy text
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Added expo-clipboard, long-press on any message copies to clipboard (commit ee621ab)

** TODO Preserve scroll position when switching channels
If user was scrolled to bottom, stay at bottom when clicking on a different agent.

** DONE Show file contents and diffs for Read/Write/Edit tools
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Display file path and content inline with tool-specific icons (commit 49b2d1c)

** DONE Show hidden files in file browser
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Added toggle switch in path bar, backend supports show_hidden param (commit 2ebf3d3)

* Low Priority (Polish)

** TODO Rename meta-agent display name to "Conductor"
The agent in .claude-meta should display as "Conductor" instead of 
"Claude Code Agent" in the graph view and elsewhere.

** DONE Color agent boxes for unread messages
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Purple border/background and badge on agents with unread messages (commit b2862ee)

** DONE Remove [RUNNING] / [COMPLETED] tags from tool messages
CLOSED: [2025-02-09]
Status now shown via icon only (⏳/✓/✗), tags stripped from display (commit ee621ab)

** TODO Better UI for message queuing
Improve frontend display of queued messages and ensure queuing works reliably.

** TODO New edits in Emacs not resolving from pending to done
When edits are made in Emacs, the UI shows them as pending but doesn't update to done.
